            In modern days there are various integrations and practices that have
            emerged to extend VCSs.
        </p>
        <p>
            GitOps - An approach that takes DevOps to Version Control, with the main idea being
            to put infrastructure configuration and deployments as code in the repository.<br>
            This grants all the benefits from VCS to the infrastructure itself and allows for
            automatic configuration via "workflows".
        </p>
        <p>
            CI/CD - These two systems allows for fast and easy issue detection and deloyment.<br>
            Continous Integration allows for fast issue detection by running automated builds
            and tests every time a change is made.<br>
            Continous Deployment (usually right after succesfull CI check) prepares and deploys
            the latest changes, which results in speedy deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cloud based platforms - By taking VCS to the cloud it allows for more features
            to be available to developers at ease.<br>
            Most VCS platforms include a host of tools for collaboration, such as Pull Requests
            which allow to propose and review changes before they hit the main code.<br>
            They also come with issue management to track issues and improvements in an easy and flexible way.<br>
            Cloud based platforms also can bring the network effect to open-source projects,
            by allowing anyone to easily fork and contribute to projects, while also building their own portfolio.
