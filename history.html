            <h2>Here's a small timeline of major VCSs:</h2>
            <p>
                1972: Source Code Control System<br>
                The very first VCS, which started the idea
                of tracking changes and was made by Bell Labs.
            </p>
            <p>
                1982: Revision Control System<br>
                Created by Walter Tichy at Purdue University, 
                it automated tracking changes by using <span style="font-style: italic;">delta storage</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                1986: Concurrent Versions System<br>
                A "front-end" to Revision Control System and the first VCS to
                introduce collaboration to version control.<br>
                Developed by Dick Grune and was the first major VCS to become widely used in 90's.
            </p>
            <p>
                2000: Subversion<br>
                A successor to Concrrent Versions System,
                it introduced atomic commits, improved file renaming and network operations handling.<br>
                By 2006 it became one of the most used VCS.
            </p>
            <p>
                2005: Git<br>
                Created by the legendary Linus Torvalds, it introduced distributed VCS
                and quickly became the number one Version Control System used by almost everyone till this day.
