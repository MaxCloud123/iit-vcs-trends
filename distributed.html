            Distributed version control compared to centralized are more resilliant to failures
            and data loss. They also allow for more collaboration flexibilty.

        <p>
            While centralized systems are easier and simpler to use and implement,
            it's also the single point of failure.<br>
            If the server goes offline, no one can work anymore; 
            furthemore if the server suffers data loss, you better hope you had manually made backups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile in distributed systems, every developer has local copy of the source code.<br>
            This allows for developers to work even if they or the server are offline and
            also provides redundancy in the event of data loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            Distributed VCS also allow for more flexibilty with different collaboration models.<br>
            Developers can set to fetch from one server but push to a different server (or even to another developer);
            and in fact it doesn't need to be one server, VCSs like GIT allow you to set multiple "remotes".<br>
            However that kind of configuration is rather rare.
